## About Me
Hi! Most folks call me Geo (she/her/hers), and I'm studying Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I decided to remain on the west coast for the time being, so I'm currently attending CMU remotely for the fall semester. Fingers crossed that spring semester is safer, and I'll be able to make the move over the Pittsburgh more comfortably. I am in the DC-track of my program, so my second year will take place at our nation's capital. 

## Why am I taking this class?
I want to be equipped in both conducting data analysis, and creating quality data visualizations when I complete the MSPPM-DC program. In my previous job, just before starting this program, the organization I was at utilized templates for dataviz in the reports we produced. I was already motivated to hone in my skill-set in working with data, but that experience made me realize that I didn't want to rely on templates; I wanted to be able to create effective presentations for data. 

## Have I used Github before?
No. 

## Will I likely make mistakes and mess up the page's presentation?
Yes. But hopefully that'll improve over time. 

## What are the 3 topics that I would crush in trivia?
The Scream triology, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and 90's r&b.
