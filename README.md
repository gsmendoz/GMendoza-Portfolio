## About Me
Hi! Most folks call me Geo (she/her/hers), and I'm studying Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I decided to remain on the west coast for the time being, so I'm currently attending CMU remotely for the fall semester. Fingers crossed that spring semester is safer, and I'll be able to make the move over the Pittsburgh more comfortably. I am in the DC-track of my program, so my second year will take place at our nation's capital. 

## Why am I taking this class?
I want to be equipped in both conducting data analysis, and creating quality data visualizations when I complete the MSPPM-DC program. In my previous job, just before starting this program, the organization I was at utilized templates for dataviz in the reports we produced. I was already motivated to hone in my skill-set in working with data, but that experience made me realize that I didn't want to rely on templates; I wanted to be able to create effective presentations for data. 

## Have I used Github before?
No. 

## Will I likely make mistakes and mess up the page's presentation?
Yes. But hopefully that'll improve over time. 

## What are the 3 topics that I would crush in trivia?
The Scream triology, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and 90's r&b.

## Data Viz 3

Played with some colors!

Due to the nature of having several small charts on the screen all at once, I knew that the charts themselves could have not much color. So in order to avoid having **too** much noise in the image, I decided to keep the charts themselves simple. Since I personally couldn't identify any countries that should have been highlighted (in particulay because not every country had data spanning the 1995-2019 timeframe), I couldn't bring attention to a specific grouping of them although I wanted to as discussed in Good Charts whenever multiple variables are being examined at once. So, I looked to Coale (Importance of Font and Color) as they noted the use of white space while trying to differentiate groups. In this instance there were a lot of groups - however since the charts themselves were pretty light (light grey background) I decided to "create space" by contrasting them with a dark background color. What also stuck with me from the Importance of Color, Font and Icons was the idea of starting out with just black and white - *then* moving on to color. This most certainly guided my decision to be conservative with colors, and to rely on grey as recommended by all three readings when searching for neutrality and to bring balance.

## Critique by Design

###### The Original Visualization

During my initial observation of the original visualization, my thoughts were that while the information told a very straight-forward story, other relevant elements in the industry could have been woven in to tell a more compelling one. While the original graphic did present what the title denoted: annual ticket sales over the course of twenty-five years, I would have liked more contextual pieces - and these elements became the building blocks for my redesign.

###### Process

As mentioned above, I was initially focused on having the target audience at least consider the contextual elements that immediately came to my attention - specifically regarding the last two years in the graph (2019-2020). I wanted them to look beyond just the ebbs and flows of the market, and take note of the downward trend (engagement from Few’s method). For example, as a consumer with several streaming subscriptions (more than I probably need), I’m aware of their status as a viable threat to box office sales, and I wonder if they had any impact on 2019’s noticeable dip. Following that, we see a tremendous drop in box office numbers and ticket sales - ramifications of the pandemic on the industry. Of course, most consumers living right now would understand the dip illustrated in 2020 without any additional information, however if this graphic were to be reviewed decades down the line, I doubt that viewers would have that same contextual understanding. As I only had this dataset to work with, I decided to highlight these ideas through both my title and subtitle, essentially creating an open-ended question (since I don’t have a definitive answer outside of 2020 - only ideas). 

As mentioned in Good Charts, “we see first what stands out” (p. 48) and so, I attempted to bring more attention to the dip on the right side of the chart without the inclusion of another dataset. Even though the original chart has the same dip, the dip didn’t stand out to me initially; I think it was due to lack of clarity on my end as I was trying to decipher the red and blue lines, and their values. Since this dataset looks at two variables over time, I didn’t think I could or should get too creative in selecting a new chart; following this, I decided on the use of a bar and line chart. I thought that the contrast between the bars and the line would do enough to more clearly differentiate the two variables (perceptibility from Few’s method). Additionally, while drafting out my sketch, I thought a lot about 1) the power of grey, and 2) making sure your message can be conveyed in black and white before adding color (both covered in Good Charts). I paid attention to alignment and tried to make it visually pleasing and interesting (aesthetic from Few’s method) while keeping its simplicity. Lastly, the inclusion of twenty-fives years worth of data seemed overkill, leading me to trim the years down to 2011-2020. After I completed my draft I solicited feedback from two different people and compiled their notes below.

*Feedback:

<ul>
<li>*"It’s a graph of movie theater tickets sold year by year”</li>
<li>*“I think it’s easy to understand!”</li>
<li>*“What is the total number of tickets sold from January - September of each year?...We still have three months of this year left.”</li>
<li>*“I don’t like that the Y axis looks to be labeled twice. The colors are not super informative.”</li>
<li>*“The film industry took a massive hit in 2020 in both revenue and total ticket sales. Also it looks like the total revenue per ticket sold is going up.”</li>
<li>*“Why does the ratio of the total revenue to ticket sold fluctuate?”</li>
<li>*“I like that one metric is shown in bars and the other is shown as a curve. Makes it easier to spot a relationship between the two.” </li>
</ul>

###### Review & Final:

Thankfully, the responses I received told me that the baseline concept was understood - this was a depiction of the ebbs and flows of ticket sales and box office revenues. Additionally, attention was drawn to the dive in 2020, along with an excellent question regarding the inclusion of data from “2020” when 2020 is in fact still happening - it made me wonder how far into 2020 the data reflected; it turns out that “2020” includes data through week 37 of the year (9/7-913). 

Positive feedback was provided regarding the chart type and the visuals between the two variables, however the dual y-axis wasn’t favored, nor were the colors. There were no comments regarding 2019, however there was further interest in the relationship between the two variables - which I’m honestly happy with as the original chart couldn’t gauge that type of interest from me. Lastly, someone noticed the fluctuation in the ratio between total revenue and ticket sales. As the original visualization did not adjust for inflation yet included those values in the dataset, I decided to incorporate those values to see if it would provide more clarity on the market summary. 

I decided to play with some colors that (at least in my mind) are connected to the academy to create some type of recall to the film industry asI didn’t want to integrate any icons. To address some of the questions I received, I provided notes on the bottom of the image providing further information on the figures. I minimized the number of ticks on each y-axis to create less noise, but I couldn’t figure out how to move the legend for the variables to their corresponding y-axis (which really frustrated me); however, there wasn’t a clear way to indicate which y-axis held the ticket sales figures and which held the total revenues without a direct label. So, unfortunately I had to incorporate some repetition for the sake of clarity and actually include labels for the y-axis’. This is my primary pet peeve with this final revision, but aside from that I’m pleased with the outcome - and motivated to learn how to navigate flourish and tableau more intricately.
