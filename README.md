## About Me
Hi! Most folks call me Geo (she/her/hers), and I'm studying Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I decided to remain on the west coast for the time being, so I'm currently attending CMU remotely for the fall semester. Fingers crossed that spring semester is safer, and I'll be able to make the move over the Pittsburgh more comfortably. I am in the DC-track of my program, so my second year will take place at our nation's capital. 

## Why am I taking this class?
I want to be equipped in both conducting data analysis, and creating quality data visualizations when I complete the MSPPM-DC program. In my previous job, just before starting this program, the organization I was at utilized templates for dataviz in the reports we produced. I was already motivated to hone in my skill-set in working with data, but that experience made me realize that I didn't want to rely on templates; I wanted to be able to create effective presentations for data. 

## Have I used Github before?
No. 

## Will I likely make mistakes and mess up the page's presentation?
Yes. But hopefully that'll improve over time. 

## What are the 3 topics that I would crush in trivia?
The Scream triology, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and 90's r&b.

## Data Viz 3

Played with some colors!

Due to the nature of having several small charts on the screen all at once, I knew that the charts themselves could have not much color. So in order to avoid having **too** much noise in the image, I decided to keep the charts themselves simple. Since I personally couldn't identify any countries that should have been highlighted (in particulay because not every country had data spanning the 1995-2019 timeframe), I couldn't bring attention to a specific grouping of them although I wanted to as discussed in Good Charts whenever multiple variables are being examined at once. So, I looked to Coale (Importance of Font and Color) as they noted the use of white space while trying to differentiate groups. In this instance there were a lot of groups - however since the charts themselves were pretty light (light grey background) I decided to "create space" by contrasting them with a dark background color. What also stuck with me from the Importance of Color, Font and Icons was the idea of starting out with just black and white - *then* moving on to color. This most certainly guided my decision to be conservative with colors, and to rely on grey as recommended by all three readings when searching for neutrality and to bring balance.
