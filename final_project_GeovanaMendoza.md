## Phase 1
###### Outline 

I want to convince my classmates that independently owned venues are in danger, but that they’re in a position to provide support. We’ve already lost many on a national level - by the time we can once again to concerts - there may be limited options.

###### Completing the project

Moving forward, I’ll be working more directly with both Shorthand and Tableau in order to use them more effectively for the final product. 
As the majority of this information are statistics, I’ll also be utilizing infogram in order to create an effective series of infographics for these data points. 
I’ll be creating visuals on tableau for broader data that is not specific to Portland (arts and entertainment proportion of national GDP), as well as 
initial figures for impacts across industries from COVID-19. Additionally, I’ll be creating my own simple data sets by collecting data on the following topics: 
total number of independent venues in Portland operating before March 2020, total number of independent venues that haven’t been forced to vacate the premises 
as of 10/1/2020, strategies they’ve utilized to raise funds, and other relevant points that are available and discovered during my initial searches. 
Additionally, I’ll be conducting a short interview with a staff member of a local promotional outlet, to learn about the impacts his company has directly experienced.

Shorthand will be my medium of choice for the final project, with a focus on Portland, Oregon, yet expanding to include national figures and references as it 
is a nationwide issue. I’ll refer to other resources such as FontJoy.com and the Good Charts text to guide me in making a persuasive and refined virtual 
presentation of my topic.
